# 1. Project Overview

Paper, Rock, and Scissor is an interactive web app centered on allowing the user to pass the time playing a fun game. The look, feel, and functionality will be explained in the following sections:

## 1.1 Project Objective

The project objective was to create an interactive and visually appealing web app, catering to those who enjoy video games, as well as games of chance.

## 1.2 User Stories

### First time users

- As a first time user I want an excellent visual experience.
- As a first time user I want to easily interact with website content.
- As a first time user I want to be able to ask for instructions of how te game is played.
- As a first time user I want to easily distingish this site as a trusted site which is safe to use.

### Returning users

- As a returning user I would like to see regular game updates.
- As a returning user I would like to have a history of my gaming score.

### Site Owner

- As a site owner I want to provide a fun and interactive gaming experience.
- As a site owner I want to have my site visually stand out.

## 1.3 Design

To serve as a gaming website, a simplistic but functional design was needed. This combination served two primary purposes. The first purpose, simplicity, was used to maintaine a pleasant look and asthetic to cater and appeal to users of varying age groups.

For the color scheme those are the colors that stand out.I used "http://colormind.io/image/" for my color palette.

# 2. Features

The website is a two pages which you can play in one page and read instructions if you press te instruction button it will take you to oter page.This gives the user the ability to play the well-known Paper, Rock, and Scissors game if tey are famliar with it.

## 2.1 Logo and Header Area

The website was organized into six main sections, those being the logo, header, score area, result area, control area and the footer.

The logo just on the top to make the page look nicer.

## 2.3 Score Count & Images Area

The game score section has the following functionalies:<br>

  1. Upon the user making a choice, the image and background color changes to reflect this choice.
  2. The game winer score count tally is incremented by 1 for every successful game won. A draw will result in no incrementation of user or computer score.

## Footer Section

The footer section contains only a copy right text.

## 2.4 Features to Implement

When there is time, I would like to add a player high score area, so that returning users are able to see their placement within all users who may have played the game on this website.
